Contract for MyToken

This is the smart contract for MyToken token (JMS). It permits the tracking of balances for various addresses in addition to the minting and burning of tokens.

Public Variables

name: A string variable that holds the token's name (JAMES). symbol: A string variable that holds the token's (JMS) symbol. totalSupply: The total supply of tokens is represented by this unsigned integer variable.

Mapping a Variable

balances: An association between an address and its accompanying token balance.

Functions

The function mint(address _address, uint _value) is used to create new tokens. It adds the designated number of tokens to the balance of the specified address and raises the overall supply.

burn(address _address, uint _value): Burning (or destroying) tokens is done with this function. It deducts the designated number of tokens from the address balance, lowers the overall supply, and determines whether the given address has enough tokens to burn.

Please be aware that the MyToken contract and its features are briefly described in this readme file. It is advised to examine the actual code implementation for more specific details.

Note:

Make sure to review and test the code thoroughly before deploying it on a live network.
